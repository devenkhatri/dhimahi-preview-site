# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves identifying and migrating hardcoded brand-related values throughout the application to the CMS (Content Management System). The focus is specifically on company branding elements like company name, contact information, social media handles, address, and location details that are currently hardcoded in constants and components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to update company name and branding information through the CMS, so that I can maintain consistent brand identity across the website without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN company name changes THEN it SHALL be updatable through CMS settings
2. WHEN company tagline or description needs updates THEN it SHALL be manageable in CMS
3. WHEN branding elements are displayed THEN they SHALL pull from CMS configuration
4. WHEN brand information is updated in CMS THEN changes SHALL be reflected across all pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business administrator, I want to manage all contact information through the CMS, so that I can keep business contact details current without requiring developer assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email addresses need updating THEN they SHALL be editable through CMS settings
2. WHEN phone numbers change THEN they SHALL be manageable in CMS
3. WHEN business address needs updates THEN it SHALL be configurable through CMS
4. WHEN contact information is displayed THEN it SHALL pull from CMS settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a marketing manager, I want to manage social media handles and links through the CMS, so that I can update social media presence without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN social media URLs need updating THEN they SHALL be editable through CMS
2. WHEN new social media platforms are added THEN they SHALL be configurable in CMS
3. WHEN social media links are displayed THEN they SHALL pull from CMS settings
4. WHEN social media information changes THEN updates SHALL be reflected across the website

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to manage location and service area information through the CMS, so that I can update geographic targeting without code deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service locations change THEN they SHALL be updatable through CMS settings
2. WHEN city or region information needs updates THEN it SHALL be manageable in CMS
3. WHEN location-based content is displayed THEN it SHALL pull from CMS configuration
4. WHEN geographic information changes THEN it SHALL be reflected in all relevant components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded brand constants migrated to CMS, so that the codebase is more maintainable and brand changes don't require code updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining constants file THEN brand-related hardcoded values SHALL be replaced with CMS calls
2. WHEN components reference brand information THEN they SHALL use CMS data instead of constants
3. WHEN brand information is needed THEN it SHALL be retrieved from CMS settings
4. WHEN CMS is unavailable THEN fallback brand information SHALL be provided

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust fallback mechanisms for brand information, so that the website remains functional even when CMS brand data is missing or invalid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CMS brand data is unavailable THEN fallback brand information SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN brand data validation fails THEN default values SHALL be used gracefully
3. WHEN CMS fails to load THEN the website SHALL continue to function with default brand data
4. WHEN brand data errors occur THEN appropriate error logging SHALL be implemented

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the existing static Dhimahi Technolabs website from a file-based content management system to a dynamic content management system powered by Payload CMS. The goal is to maintain the exact same visual appearance and functionality while enabling non-technical users to manage all website content through an intuitive admin interface.

The current site uses Next.js with content stored in markdown files and TypeScript data structures. The transformation will involve setting up Payload CMS as a headless CMS, migrating all existing content, and updating the frontend to fetch data from Payload APIs while preserving the existing design and user experience.

challenge: |
  A mid-sized pharmaceutical distributor was spending over ₹42 lakhs annually on software licenses across 14 different applications, many with overlapping functionality. Staff spent excessive time on manual data re-entry between disconnected systems.

  **Technology Landscape Issues:**
  - 14 separate applications across procurement, sales, warehousing, and accounting
  - 4 different tools performing similar inventory tracking functions
  - No single source of truth for stock levels or order status
  - Legacy DOS-based system still handling critical drug batch tracking

  **Cost & Efficiency Problems:**
  - ₹42 lakhs annual software spend with poor utilisation rates
  - 3 full-time staff dedicated to manual data synchronisation
  - Compliance reporting requiring 2 days of manual data compilation
  - Frequent stockouts due to disconnected demand forecasting

solution:
  - "Conducted comprehensive inventory of all 14 applications with usage analytics and cost mapping"
  - "Identified 4 redundant systems and mapped consolidation paths"
  - "Designed integration architecture around a core ERP with best-of-breed add-ons"
  - "Mapped 5 AI opportunities including demand forecasting and automated compliance reporting"
  - "Created phased migration roadmap with risk mitigation for regulatory-critical systems"

## Project Overview

MedSupply Gujarat Pvt Ltd, a regional pharmaceutical distributor serving 800+ pharmacies across Gujarat, was burdened by a sprawling technology landscape that had grown organically over 12 years. With 14 separate applications and rising IT costs, they needed a strategic approach to rationalise their portfolio and prepare for AI adoption.

## The Challenge

### Fragmented Technology Landscape
- **14 separate applications** accumulated over 12 years without strategic oversight
- **4 inventory tracking tools** across warehousing, procurement, sales, and accounting
- **Legacy DOS-based batch tracking** system critical for drug safety regulation
- **No integration layer** — data moved between systems via manual export/import

### Rising Costs with Diminishing Returns
- **₹42 lakhs annual** software licensing and maintenance costs
- **3 full-time employees** dedicated solely to re-keying data between systems
- **Frequent licence audits** revealing significant shelfware across departments
- **Growing compliance risk** from manual processes in a regulated industry

### Missed Modernisation Opportunities
- **No demand forecasting** despite having 5 years of rich sales data
- **Manual compliance reporting** consuming 2 full days each month
- **No mobile access** for field sales representatives
- **Customer service bottlenecks** from inability to check real-time stock

## Our Rationalisation Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory (Week 1)
- Catalogued all 14 applications with licence costs, user counts, and business functions
- Conducted stakeholder interviews across 6 departments
- Mapped data flows and identified 23 manual transfer points
- Documented technical debt and compliance risks in legacy systems

### Phase 2: Analysis & Optimisation (Weeks 2-3)
- Scored each application on business value, technical health, and cost efficiency
- Identified 4 redundant systems with overlapping capabilities
- Modelled 3 consolidation scenarios with projected costs and risks
- Benchmarked against industry-standard pharma distribution platforms

### Phase 3: AI Opportunity Mapping (Week 4)
- Analysed daily business processes for automation potential
- Identified 5 high-impact AI use cases:
  1. **Demand forecasting** using historical sales and seasonal patterns
  2. **Automated compliance reporting** with data aggregation
  3. **Intelligent stock reordering** based on consumption trends
  4. **Expiry date management** with automated FEFO optimisation
  5. **Customer order prediction** for proactive outreach

### Phase 4: Strategy & Roadmap (Week 5)
- Delivered comprehensive rationalisation strategy
- Created phased migration plan prioritising quick wins
- Defined KPIs and success metrics for each phase
- Provided vendor evaluation framework for replacement systems

## Results Achieved

### Cost Savings
- **35% reduction** in annual IT spend (₹14.7 lakhs saved)
- **Eliminated 3 redundant** licence subscriptions immediately
- **Reduced support costs** by consolidating vendor relationships
- **Projected 50% savings** upon full migration completion

### Operational Improvements
- **80% reduction** in manual data entry after initial consolidation
- **Compliance reporting** reduced from 2 days to 2 hours
- **Real-time stock visibility** across all 3 warehouse locations
- **Single customer view** enabling better service and upselling

### Strategic Readiness
- **Clear AI roadmap** with 5 prioritised use cases and projected ROI
- **Modern architecture blueprint** supporting future growth
- **Data governance framework** ensuring regulatory compliance
- **Change management plan** for smooth team transitions

## Client Testimonial

**Nikhil Desai**, Managing Director, MedSupply Gujarat Pvt Ltd

## Ongoing Impact

The rationalisation engagement has set MedSupply on a transformative path:
- **AI demand forecasting** pilot launched within 2 months of engagement
- **Automated compliance reporting** implemented in first consolidation phase
- **Mobile sales app** deployed using data from unified platform
- **Vendor renegotiations** secured additional 15% savings on retained systems

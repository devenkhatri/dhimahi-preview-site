  An industrial equipment supplier relied entirely on trade shows, cold calling,
  and referrals for new business. With declining trade show ROI and salesmen
  struggling to reach decision-makers, they needed a digital lead generation
  strategy.


  **Marketing Challenges:**

  - 90% of leads coming from trade shows (4 events/year) creating
  feast-or-famine pipeline

  - Cold calling yielding only 2% conversion rate

  - No website presence for products — buyers couldn't find them online

  - Competitors investing heavily in Google Ads capturing search demand


  **Sales Process Gaps:**

  - No lead nurturing — prospects either bought immediately or were forgotten

  - No CRM — customer data scattered across individual salesperson notebooks

  - Technical product specifications not accessible online

  - No content demonstrating expertise to build buyer confidence
solution:
  - Built product-focused website with detailed specifications and enquiry forms
  - Launched Google Ads targeting high-intent industrial equipment searches
  - >-
    Created technical content marketing strategy with case studies and
    whitepapers
  - Implemented HubSpot CRM with automated lead scoring and nurturing
  - >-
    Developed LinkedIn presence targeting procurement managers and plant
    engineers

    We used to depend entirely on trade shows for leads. Now our website and
    Google Ads generate more qualified prospects in a month than we used to get
    in a quarter. The CRM has transformed how our sales team operates.

## Project Overview

Gujarat Industrial Equipments, a Rajkot-based supplier of CNC machines, compressors, and industrial automation equipment, had built their business over 20 years through trade shows and personal relationships. But with trade show costs rising and ROI declining, they needed digital channels to generate a steady flow of qualified B2B leads.

## The Challenge

### Feast-or-Famine Pipeline
- **4 trade shows annually** generating 80% of yearly leads — huge concentration risk
- **3-month dry spells** between trade shows with minimal lead flow
- **₹15 lakhs annual trade show investment** with declining returns
- **Competitors' Google Ads** capturing buyers searching online for equipment

### Outdated Sales Process
- **Cold calling** yielding just 2% conversion — decision-makers unreachable by phone
- **No CRM system** — leads tracked in individual salesperson notebooks
- **No lead nurturing** — prospects who weren't ready lost forever
- **No digital content** building trust before sales conversations

## Our Strategy

### Phase 1: Digital Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Built comprehensive product website with 200+ product pages, specifications, and comparison tools
- Implemented SEO targeting 500+ industrial equipment keywords
- Created enquiry forms with intelligent routing to relevant sales team members
- Set up Google Analytics with conversion tracking and goal funnel analysis

### Phase 2: Lead Generation Engine (Months 2-5)
- Launched Google Ads campaigns targeting high-intent searches ("CNC machine price India", "industrial compressor supplier Gujarat")
- Created technical downloadable content (buyer guides, specification comparison sheets)
- Built LinkedIn company page and launched targeted ads reaching plant engineers and procurement heads
- Developed automated email sequences for lead nurturing

### Phase 3: Sales Enablement (Months 3-6)
- Deployed HubSpot CRM with custom pipeline stages for industrial equipment sales
- Implemented lead scoring based on engagement (website visits, downloads, email opens)
- Created automated alerts for sales-ready leads based on behaviour triggers
- Built reporting dashboard tracking lead source, conversion rate, and revenue attribution

### Phase 4: Content Authority (Months 4-8)
- Published monthly technical blog posts and equipment guides
- Created 5 detailed case studies from existing customer successes
- Produced product demonstration videos for YouTube and website
- Launched quarterly webinars on industrial automation trends

## Results

### Lead Generation
- **150+ qualified leads monthly** by month 6 (vs 40-50 from trade shows)
- **60% lower cost per lead** compared to trade show acquisition
- **35% of leads** from organic search (zero previous organic traffic)
- **LinkedIn campaigns** reaching 10,000+ relevant decision-makers monthly

### Sales Impact
- **₹2.5 crore pipeline** built in 8 months through digital channels
- **Lead-to-opportunity conversion** improved from 2% (cold calling) to 18% (digital leads)
- **Average deal cycle** shortened by 3 weeks through pre-educated buyers
- **3 enterprise accounts** won that discovered them through Google search

### Digital Presence
- **1,200% traffic increase** combining organic and paid channels
- **200+ product pages** indexed and ranking for targeted keywords
- **Top 5 Google ranking** for 30+ key industry terms
- **Technical content** establishing thought leadership in Gujarat industrial market

## Client Testimonial

*"Twenty years of trade shows never built a pipeline like this. Our website now generates more qualified leads in a month than our best trade show ever did. The CRM finally gives me visibility into what our sales team is actually doing."*

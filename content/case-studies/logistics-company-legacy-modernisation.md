  A logistics company operating 150+ vehicles across Gujarat was running critical operations on legacy systems over 10 years old, suffering frequent downtime and inability to meet customer expectations for real-time tracking.

  **Legacy System Risks:**
  - Fleet management software running on Windows Server 2008 with no vendor support
  - Custom-built dispatch system with single developer dependency
  - Billing system requiring manual export to accounting software
  - No mobile access for 50+ field drivers and supervisors

  **Operational Impact:**
  - 4-6 hours of system downtime per month during peak operations
  - No real-time shipment tracking — customers called for updates
  - Route planning done manually on paper maps
  - Invoice generation delayed by 3-5 days after delivery

solution:
  - "Assessed all legacy systems for technical debt, security risks, and business criticality"
  - "Designed cloud-first modernisation strategy with phased migration approach"
  - "Identified AI opportunity for route optimisation using historical delivery data"
  - "Created vendor evaluation matrix for fleet management and TMS platforms"
  - "Delivered risk mitigation plan ensuring zero operational disruption during transition"

## Project Overview

SpeedCargo Logistics, operating 150+ vehicles across Gujarat, was running operations on legacy systems that hadn't been updated in over a decade. Frequent downtime, zero mobile access, and no real-time tracking were causing customer churn and operational inefficiency. They needed a strategic modernisation plan without disrupting daily operations.

## The Challenge

### Critical Legacy Risks
- **Fleet management system** on unsupported Windows Server 2008
- **Custom dispatch application** with single-developer dependency — if they left, operations would halt
- **No disaster recovery** — a single hardware failure could stop operations for days
- **Security vulnerabilities** from unpatched legacy software

### Operational Inefficiencies
- **4-6 hours monthly downtime** during critical delivery windows
- **Manual route planning** using paper maps and driver experience
- **No real-time tracking** — customers had to call for shipment updates
- **Invoice delays** of 3-5 days due to manual data entry from delivery receipts

## Our Rationalisation Approach

### Phase 1: Risk Assessment & Inventory
- Catalogued all systems with technical health scores and risk ratings
- Identified 3 systems at critical risk (no vendor support, single dependencies)
- Mapped all business processes dependent on legacy systems
- Documented data formats and integration points for migration planning

### Phase 2: Modernisation Strategy
- Evaluated 8 cloud-based fleet management platforms against requirements
- Designed cloud-first architecture on AWS with multi-availability zone setup
- Created data migration strategy preserving 7 years of operational history
- Planned mobile app rollout for drivers, supervisors, and customers

### Phase 3: AI Opportunity Mapping
- Analysed 3 years of delivery data across 150+ vehicles
- Identified route optimisation potential using historical traffic and delivery patterns
- Modelled projected fuel savings from AI-optimised routing
- Recommended predictive maintenance capabilities using vehicle telemetry

## Results Achieved

### Infrastructure Reliability
- **90% reduction** in system downtime with cloud hosting
- **99.9% uptime SLA** from cloud-based fleet management platform
- **Automated backups** with disaster recovery capability
- **Zero vendor lock-in** risk with multi-cloud strategy

### Operational Efficiency
- **22% fuel cost reduction** through AI-powered route optimisation
- **Same-day invoicing** automated from digital delivery confirmation
- **Real-time tracking** available to all customers via mobile app
- **50+ drivers** empowered with mobile access to assignments and navigation

### Business Growth
- **Customer satisfaction** improved from 3.1/5 to 4.7/5
- **15% increase** in customer retention within first 6 months
- **New enterprise clients** won through real-time tracking capabilities
- **Predictive maintenance** reducing vehicle breakdown incidents by 35%

## Client Testimonial

*"We were one server crash away from a complete shutdown. Dhīmahi assessed our risks, showed us a clear path to modernisation, and the AI route optimisation was the cherry on top. Best investment we've made in 15 years."*

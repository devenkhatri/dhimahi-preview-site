challenge: |
  A farming cooperative with 200+ members cultivating 500+ acres faced unpredictable crop yields, excessive water consumption, and inability to detect crop diseases early, leading to significant losses each season.

  **Agricultural Challenges:**
  - Traditional irrigation causing 40% water wastage through over-watering
  - Crop diseases detected only after visible damage, losing 15-25% of yield
  - No soil health data for informed fertiliser decisions
  - Weather unpredictability without localised forecasting

  **Economic Impact:**
  - Average 20% yield loss due to diseases and poor water management
  - ₹15 lakhs annual fertiliser over-spend due to blanket application
  - Individual farmers unable to afford precision agriculture technology
  - No data-driven decision support for crop selection or timing

solution:
  - "Deployed 150 IoT soil sensors across 500 acres monitoring moisture, pH, and nutrients"
  - "Built AI model for crop disease detection using drone imagery and satellite data"
  - "Created automated irrigation scheduling optimising water usage by field conditions"
  - "Developed mobile app with Gujarati interface for farmer-friendly alerts and recommendations"
  - "Implemented weather prediction integration for localised farming advisories"

## Project Overview

Kisan Sahkari Mandli, a farming cooperative with 200+ members in Anand district, was facing the same challenges that plague Indian agriculture — unpredictable yields, water wastage, and late disease detection. Individual farmers couldn't afford precision agriculture technology, but the cooperative structure allowed us to deploy an AI-powered monitoring system that benefited all members across 500+ acres.

## The Challenge

### Water Management
- **40% water wastage** through traditional flood irrigation
- **No soil moisture data** — irrigation based on visual judgment and calendar
- **Groundwater depletion** threatening long-term farming viability
- **Uneven water distribution** causing some areas to be overwatered, others parched

### Crop Health
- **Disease detection only after visible damage** — typically 15-25% yield already lost
- **Blanket pesticide application** regardless of actual infestation levels
- **No variety-specific guidance** for different crops across the cooperative
- **Knowledge gap** between agricultural research and farmer practice

### Economic Pressure
- **₹15 lakhs annual** over-spend on fertilisers and pesticides
- **20% average yield loss** that better management could prevent
- **No market timing intelligence** for optimal selling
- **Individual farmers unable** to invest in modern agricultural technology

## Our Solution

### IoT Sensor Network
- Deployed 150 soil sensors measuring moisture, pH, temperature, and nutrient levels
- Connected via LoRaWAN network covering 500+ acres with low-power, long-range communication
- Set up 5 weather stations for hyperlocal climate monitoring
- Created sensor maintenance protocol with farmer involvement

### AI Disease Detection
- Trained computer vision model on 100,000+ crop images for common Gujarat diseases
- Integrated bi-weekly drone surveys with satellite imagery analysis
- Built early warning system detecting disease patterns 5-7 days before visible symptoms
- Created treatment recommendation engine suggesting targeted interventions

### Smart Irrigation
- Developed AI irrigation scheduler using soil moisture, weather forecast, and crop water needs
- Integrated with existing pump and drip irrigation infrastructure
- Created automated alerts when fields need watering
- Optimised schedules to minimise electricity costs (aligning with off-peak power rates)

### Farmer Mobile App
- Built mobile app entirely in Gujarati with voice-enabled features
- Provided daily field-by-field recommendations for irrigation and care
- Included crop market prices and weather forecasts
- Enabled photo-based disease identification for instant diagnosis

## Results

### Resource Efficiency
- **30% reduction** in water usage through precision irrigation
- **₹8 lakhs annual savings** on fertiliser through targeted application
- **40% reduction** in pesticide usage via early disease detection
- **Electricity costs** reduced through optimised pump scheduling

### Yield Improvement
- **22% increase** in average crop yield in first harvest cycle
- **Disease losses** reduced from 15-25% to under 5%
- **Crop quality improvement** commanding 10-15% premium pricing
- **Second crop planning** enabled by soil health insights

### Community Impact
- **200+ farmers** empowered with data-driven decision making
- **Knowledge sharing** through cooperative-wide crop insights
- **Youth engagement** — younger farmers attracted to tech-enabled farming
- **Model replicated** by 2 neighbouring cooperatives

## Client Testimonial

*"My father farmed by intuition for 40 years. This system shows us what's happening underground that we could never see. The water savings alone paid for the system. Our farmers are now earning 22% more per acre."*

**Mukeshbhai Patel**, Chairman, Kisan Sahkari Mandli

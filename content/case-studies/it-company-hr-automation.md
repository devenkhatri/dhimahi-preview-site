## Project Overview

TechVista Solutions, a growing IT services company in Ahmedabad with 200+ employees, faced an ironic challenge — as a technology company, their own HR processes were painfully manual. Spreadsheet-based leave tracking, email-driven approvals, and a basic HRMS that couldn't scale were creating frustration for employees and overwhelming the 4-person HR team.

## The Challenge

### HR Team Overwhelm
- **70% of HR capacity** consumed by repetitive queries (leave balance, policy clarifications, reimbursement status)
- **Payroll processing** requiring 5 full working days of manual effort monthly
- **Onboarding** involving 15 manual steps across 3 disconnected systems
- **Compliance tracking** for PF, ESI, and professional tax done in spreadsheets

### Employee Frustration
- **No self-service access** — every small request needed an email to HR
- **Leave request approvals** taking 2-3 days through email chains
- **Reimbursement processing** stretching to 2-3 weeks
- **No transparency** on compensation breakdowns or appraisal timelines
- **Employee satisfaction with HR** rated at 3.2/5 in internal surveys

## Our Solution

### Intelligent HRMS Platform
- Deployed comprehensive HRMS with role-based access for employees, managers, and HR
- Built self-service portal for leave requests, attendance, payslips, and documents
- Created mobile-responsive interface for on-the-go access
- Integrated with existing Slack workspace for seamless notifications

### AI HR Chatbot
- Trained chatbot on complete HR policy documentation (leave, benefits, compliance)
- Implemented conversational interface answering 85% of common HR queries instantly
- Built escalation workflow for complex queries routed to appropriate HR specialist
- Enabled natural language leave applications ("Apply for 2 days leave from Monday")

### Automated Workflows
- **Payroll automation**: Integrated biometric attendance → tax calculation → salary processing → bank transfer
- **Onboarding workflow**: Reduced 15 manual steps to 3 digital touchpoints
- **Reimbursement processing**: Photo upload → manager approval → finance processing → payment in 48 hours
- **Appraisal cycle**: Automated goal setting, review scheduling, and feedback collection

### Predictive Analytics
- Built attrition prediction model using engagement, performance, and behavioural signals
- Created workforce planning dashboard for hiring and skill gap analysis
- Implemented diversity and inclusion tracking
- Developed manager effectiveness scorecard based on team metrics

## Results

### HR Efficiency
- **85% of processes** fully automated
- **HR team workload** reduced by 60%, enabling strategic initiatives
- **Payroll processing** reduced from 5 days to 4 hours
- **Policy query response** improved from 24+ hours to instant (chatbot)

### Employee Experience
- **Employee satisfaction** with HR improved from 3.2/5 to 4.6/5
- **Leave requests** approved within 2 hours vs previous 2-3 days
- **Reimbursements** processed in 48 hours vs 2-3 weeks
- **Self-service adoption** reached 95% within first month

### Business Impact
- **Attrition reduced** by 15% through early intervention from predictive alerts
- **Onboarding time** cut from 2 weeks to 2 days
- **Compliance** fully automated with zero missed deadlines
- **HR team** now focused on culture building and strategic initiatives

## Client Testimonial

*"For an IT company, our HR was embarrassingly manual. The AI chatbot alone saved our HR team 3 hours daily. Employees love the self-service portal, and I love the predictive analytics that help us retain our best talent."*

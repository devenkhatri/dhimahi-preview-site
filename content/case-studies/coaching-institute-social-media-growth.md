## Project Overview

Lakshya Academy, a Gandhinagar-based coaching institute specialising in GPSC, banking, and SSC exam preparation, had an impressive track record — multiple top-10 rankers and 15 years of experience. But they were bleeding students to national chains and online platforms that outspent them 10:1 on marketing. They needed a digital strategy that showcased their actual strengths: teaching quality and results.

## The Challenge

### Competitive Landscape
- **National chains** (Allen, Resonance) spending ₹1 crore+ on advertising in Gujarat
- **Online platforms** offering free content creating perception of paid coaching being unnecessary
- **Local competitors** copying Lakshya's newspaper ad strategy, saturating the channel
- **Parent demographics** shifting — even in tier-2 cities, parents research online before enrolling

### Invisible Track Record
- **15 years of results** but zero digital documentation
- **Top rankers** not leveraged as brand ambassadors
- **Faculty expertise** unknown beyond existing student network
- **No YouTube presence** in a category where students consume 3+ hours of educational content daily

## Our Strategy

### Phase 1: YouTube Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Created YouTube channel with professional branding aligned with academy identity
- Filmed and published 3 high-quality educational videos per week (GPSC, banking, current affairs)
- Developed "Toppers Talk" series featuring successful students sharing strategies
- Implemented YouTube SEO with keyword research for competitive exam queries

### Phase 2: Social Media Ecosystem (Months 2-5)
- Built Instagram presence with daily current affairs posts, exam tips, and motivational content
- Created Facebook groups for GPSC and banking aspirants (community building)
- Launched Telegram channel for daily practice questions and updates
- Developed student-generated content programme (study vlogs, exam day experiences)

### Phase 3: Paid Student Acquisition (Months 3-7)
- Launched Google Ads targeting "GPSC coaching Gandhinagar", "banking exam classes Gujarat"
- Created Meta Ads with video testimonials from top rankers
- Built landing pages with batch information, demo class registration, and fee structure
- Implemented WhatsApp automation for inquiry follow-up and demo class reminders

### Phase 4: Conversion Optimisation (Months 5-10)
- Created free online workshop funnels as top-of-funnel acquisition
- Built email/WhatsApp drip sequences nurturing inquiries over 2-3 week decision period
- Developed parent-specific content addressing concerns about coaching selection
- Implemented referral incentive programme for existing students

## Results

### Enrollment & Revenue
- **180% increase** in student enrollment compared to previous year
- **Cost per enrollment** reduced by 65% vs traditional newspaper advertising
- **3 new batches** launched to accommodate demand (previously struggling to fill 1)
- **Premium batch** pricing increased by 20% justified by brand value

### Digital Presence
- **75,000+ YouTube subscribers** from zero in 10 months
- **2 million+ video views** on educational content
- **15,000+ Instagram followers** with daily engagement
- **5,000+ Telegram community** members for daily study material

### Search Dominance
- **#1 Google ranking** for "GPSC coaching Gujarat" and 10+ related keywords
- **Top 3 YouTube results** for multiple competitive exam topics
- **Google My Business** profile optimised with 150+ reviews (4.8/5)
- **Organic inquiries** now accounting for 40% of total leads

### Community Building
- **Facebook study groups** with 3,000+ active members
- **Weekly live Q&A** sessions averaging 500+ live viewers
- **Alumni network** digitised with 2,000+ past students connected
- **Student-to-student referrals** increased 3x through social proof

## Client Testimonial

*"I was ready to shut down one location because enrollment had dropped so much. Dhīmahi's YouTube strategy didn't just bring students back — it brought a flood. Our teaching quality was always there; now students can see it before they enroll. I wish we had done this 5 years ago."*

**Prof. Rakesh Trivedi**, Director, Lakshya Academy

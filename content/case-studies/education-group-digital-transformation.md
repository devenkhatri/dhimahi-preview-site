challenge: >
  An education group running 5 school campuses had each campus independently
  adopting technology, resulting in 18 different applications across campuses
  with no standardisation, data sharing, or central oversight.


  **Technology Chaos:**

  - 18 different applications across 5 campuses with no standardisation

  - 3 different student information systems making group-level reporting
  impossible

  - Each campus paying separately for similar tools, missing volume discounts

  - No integration between academic, administrative, and communication systems


  **Strategic Concerns:**

  - ₹28 lakhs annual combined IT spend with no centralised procurement

  - Parents receiving different digital experiences depending on campus

  - Teacher training fragmented across multiple platforms

  - No data-driven insights into student performance across the group
solution:
  - Conducted campus-by-campus technology audit across all 5 locations
  - Identified standardisation opportunities and group-level volume discounts
  - Designed unified EdTech architecture with campus-specific flexibility
  - >-
    Mapped AI opportunities for personalised learning and administrative
    automation

    Created 18-month digital transformation roadmap aligned with academic

## Project Overview

Vidya Education Group operates 5 school campuses across Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, serving 8,000+ students. Over the years, each campus principal had independently adopted technology solutions, resulting in a fragmented landscape of 18 different applications with no standardisation, shared data, or group-level insights.

## The Challenge

### Campus-Level Fragmentation
- **3 different Student Information Systems** making group reporting impossible
- **4 different communication tools** creating inconsistent parent experience
- **Separate LMS platforms** preventing curriculum sharing between campuses
- **Independent procurement** missing ₹8+ lakhs in potential volume discounts

### Strategic Gaps
- **No group-level analytics** on student performance trends
- **Teacher technology skills** varying wildly between campuses
- **Parent complaints** about different digital experiences per campus
- **No AI readiness** despite rich student learning data across 5 years

## Our Approach

### Multi-Campus Discovery
- Deployed assessment teams to all 5 campuses simultaneously
- Catalogued 18 applications with overlap analysis and cost mapping
- Surveyed 200+ teachers, 50+ administrators, and 500+ parents
- Identified 7 functional areas where 2-4 tools were doing the same job

### Standardisation Strategy
- Selected best-in-class platforms through weighted scoring (functionality, cost, ease of use)
- Designed unified architecture allowing campus-specific configurations where needed
- Modelled volume discount savings from group-level procurement
- Created data migration strategy preserving student records across all systems

### AI & Innovation Roadmap
- Identified personalised learning opportunities using existing assessment data
- Recommended AI-powered early warning system for at-risk students
- Designed automated administrative workflows for admissions and fee collection
- Proposed analytics dashboard for group-level academic performance insights

## Results

- **30% IT cost reduction** through standardisation and volume discounts
- **18 applications consolidated to 7** core platforms
- **Parent satisfaction** jumped from 68% to 92% with unified experience
- **15 hours per week** saved in administrative time per campus
- **Group-level reporting** enabling data-driven education strategy
- **AI pilot** for personalised learning recommendations launched in 2 campuses

## Client Testimonial

*"We thought technology was supposed to make things easier, but with 18 different tools, it was chaos. Dhīmahi's campus-by-campus assessment and unified strategy gave us clarity, savings, and a roadmap to truly personalised education."*

## Project Overview

Swad Restaurant Group, a beloved Gujarati restaurant chain with 5 locations across Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, faced significant challenges in the post-COVID landscape. Despite serving authentic, high-quality food for over 15 years, they were losing customers to digitally-savvy competitors and struggling with online visibility.

## Project Overview

SmileCare Dental Clinics, operating 3 locations across Ahmedabad with 6 dentists, offered premium dental services including implants, orthodontics, and cosmetic dentistry. Despite clinical excellence, they were virtually invisible online — patients searching "dentist near me" or "dental clinic Ahmedabad" would never find them. Meanwhile, competitors with fewer qualifications were dominating Google.

## The Challenge

### Google Invisibility
- **Zero locations** appearing in Google Maps 3-pack for any dental keyword
- **Page 5+ rankings** for target keywords like "dental implants Ahmedabad"
- **Incomplete GMB profiles** — no photos, limited services listed, inconsistent hours
- **Only 12 total reviews** across 3 locations (competitors had 100+)

### Wasted Potential
- **Premium services** (implants at ₹25,000+) invisible to online searchers
- **Specialised dentists** with international certifications — credentials not showcased
- **No educational content** to build patient trust before first visit
- **Walk-in dependent** — 90% of new patients from word-of-mouth

## Our Strategy

### Phase 1: Google My Business Optimisation (Month 1)
- Claimed and verified all 3 GMB profiles with consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
- Added 50+ professional interior and treatment photos per location
- Listed all services with descriptions, pricing ranges, and insurance accepted
- Created weekly GMB posts highlighting treatments, offers, and patient stories

### Phase 2: Review Generation System (Months 1-4)
- Implemented post-visit SMS review request system
- Trained receptionist team on review request timing and approach
- Created simple review submission workflow (direct link to Google review)
- Responded professionally to all reviews within 24 hours
- **Result**: Grew from 12 reviews to 200+ with 4.9/5 average rating

### Phase 3: Local SEO Content Strategy (Months 2-5)
- Published 30+ blog posts targeting long-tail dental keywords
- Created location-specific landing pages for each service at each clinic
- Built internal linking structure connecting service pages, blog content, and location pages
- Earned local backlinks through dental health articles in Ahmedabad publications

### Phase 4: Targeted Google Ads (Months 3-6)
- Launched location-targeted campaigns for high-value services
- Created service-specific landing pages with clear CTAs and appointment booking
- Implemented call tracking to measure phone call conversions
- Optimised campaigns weekly based on cost-per-appointment data

## Results

### Search Visibility
- **#1 Google ranking** for 15+ dental keywords including "dentist Ahmedabad", "dental implants Ahmedabad"
- **Google Maps 3-pack** position for all 3 locations
- **500% organic traffic growth** within 6 months
- **Featured snippets** for 5 dental FAQ queries

### Patient Growth
- **200% increase** in online appointment bookings
- **35% of new patients** now discovering clinic through Google search
- **High-value service inquiries** (implants, cosmetic) up 300%
- **Walk-in dependency** reduced from 90% to 55%

### Reputation Excellence
- **4.9/5 Google rating** with 200+ reviews (from 3.8/5 with 12 reviews)
- **95% positive review rate** with professional responses to all feedback
- **Patient trust** visibly increased — many mention reviews in first visit
- **Competitor differentiation** through consistent online reputation

## Client Testimonial

*"We're dentists, not marketers. We didn't know Google My Business even existed. Now we're the top-rated dental clinic in Ahmedabad on Google, and 35% of our new patients come from online search. The review strategy was simple but transformative."*

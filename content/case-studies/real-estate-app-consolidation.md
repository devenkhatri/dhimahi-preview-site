    We were losing lakhs in leads simply because our systems didn't talk to each
    other. Dhīmahi's rationalisation strategy unified everything, and the AI
    lead scoring has been a game-changer for our sales team.

## Project Overview

Shilp Infrastructure, a growing real estate developer with 4 active residential projects in the Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad corridor, approached us after realising their rapidly growing tool stack was actually hurting their business. With 11 separate applications and no integration, leads were being lost and customer experience was suffering.

## The Challenge

### Technology Sprawl
- **3 CRM systems** adopted independently by different sales teams
- **Separate project management** tools for construction and sales functions
- **No marketing attribution** — unable to trace which campaigns generated revenue
- **Manual Excel reports** consolidating data from multiple sources weekly

### Business Impact
- **30% of inbound leads** not followed up within 48 hours
- **Duplicate customer communications** creating confusion and complaints
- **No consolidated view** of project performance or sales pipeline
- **₹18 lakhs annually** spent on overlapping software subscriptions

## Our Approach

### Discovery & Assessment
- Interviewed 15 stakeholders across sales, marketing, construction, and finance
- Mapped all 11 applications with user counts, costs, and capability overlaps
- Identified that 3 CRM tools covered 70% identical functionality
- Discovered marketing spend data completely disconnected from conversion metrics

### Consolidation Strategy
- Recommended HubSpot CRM as single customer platform replacing 3 existing tools
- Designed integration architecture connecting CRM, project management, and accounting
- Created data migration plan preserving 5 years of customer interaction history
- Modelled cost savings and ROI for consolidation initiative

### AI Opportunity Identification
- Analysed 5 years of historical lead data (12,000+ records)
- Identified patterns in lead-to-customer conversion by source, demographics, and behaviour
- Designed AI lead scoring model to prioritise high-probability buyers
- Recommended automated nurture workflows triggered by engagement signals

## Results

### Immediate Impact
- **₹18 lakhs annual savings** from eliminated redundant subscriptions
- **Lead response time** improved from 48 hours to under 2 hours
- **Single customer view** enabling personalised engagement across touchpoints
- **Automated marketing attribution** providing clear ROI by channel

### AI-Driven Growth
- **45% increase** in lead-to-site-visit conversion rate
- **AI lead scoring** prioritising top 20% of leads that generate 80% of bookings
- **Automated follow-up sequences** ensuring no lead goes cold
- **Predictive insights** helping plan inventory across projects

## Client Testimonial

*"The rationalisation exercise opened our eyes. We were paying for 11 tools and getting less value than we now get from 5. The AI lead scoring alone has generated more revenue than our entire IT spend."*

**Amit Thakkar**, Director of Sales, Shilp Infrastructure

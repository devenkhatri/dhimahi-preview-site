challenge: >
  A growing CA firm handling 500+ clients was drowning in disconnected tools for
  accounting, tax filing, client management, and document storage. Staff spent
  more time switching between tools than serving clients.


  **Tool Overload:**

  - 9 separate applications for daily operations

  - No integration between Tally, client CRM, and tax filing tools

  - Document storage split across Google Drive, local servers, and email

  - Client communication tracked in WhatsApp, email, and spreadsheets separately


  **Productivity Impact:**

  - 2 hours daily per staff member lost to context switching and data re-entry

  - GST filing deadlines missed due to manual data compilation

  - Client queries taking 30+ minutes to resolve due to scattered information

  - Partner unable to track team workload or billing efficiency
solution:
  - Audited all 9 applications with detailed usage and cost analysis
  - >-
    Designed consolidated stack around Tally Prime with integrated CRM and
    document management
  - Identified automation opportunities for GST compliance and client reporting
  - Created migration plan with emphasis on tax season continuity
  - Delivered training roadmap for smooth team adoption

    As CAs, we advise clients on efficiency, but our own systems were a mess.
    Dhīmahi helped us practise what we preach. Our team is happier, clients get
    faster responses, and we haven't missed a filing deadline since.

## Project Overview

Sharma & Associates, a well-established CA firm in Ahmedabad serving 500+ clients across GST, income tax, and audit services, recognised that their growing tool stack was becoming a liability rather than an asset. Staff morale was declining as they spent more time managing tools than serving clients.

## The Challenge

The firm's technology had grown organically over 8 years, resulting in:
- **9 separate tools** including Tally, 2 CRM systems, 3 document storage solutions, and multiple communication platforms
- **No single client view** — information about each client scattered across tools
- **Manual GST compilation** requiring data from 4 different sources
- **₹3.6 lakhs annual spend** on software that largely duplicated functionality

## Our Approach

### Rapid Assessment (Week 1)
- Shadowed 5 staff members to understand actual daily tool usage
- Discovered that 3 tools had less than 20% feature utilisation
- Mapped all client data touchpoints across the 9 applications
- Quantified time lost to context switching and manual data transfer

### Consolidation Design (Week 2)
- Centred architecture around Tally Prime as the accounting backbone
- Selected Zoho CRM for unified client management replacing 2 existing tools
- Standardised on Google Workspace for all document storage and collaboration
- Integrated ClearTax for streamlined GST and ITR filing

### Roadmap Delivery (Week 3)
- Phased migration plan avoiding disruption during tax filing seasons
- Data migration strategy for 5 years of client history
- Staff training calendar aligned with tool rollout schedule
- Automation blueprint for GST data compilation and client reporting

## Results

- **40% reduction** in annual software costs
- **2 hours daily** saved per staff member from eliminated context switching
- **Client query resolution** improved from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes
- **100% on-time GST filing** since implementation
- **Partner dashboard** providing real-time visibility into team workload and billing

## Client Testimonial

*"The assessment was an eye-opener. We had no idea we were paying for tools nobody used properly. The consolidated stack is simpler, cheaper, and our team actually enjoys using it."*

When you need new functionality, should you build a custom application, buy a commercial product, or integrate existing tools? A decision framework for SMEs.

## The Three Options

### Option 1: Buy (Commercial Software / SaaS)
**What:** Purchase a ready-made application from a vendor.

**Advantages:**
- Fastest time to value (days to weeks)
- Proven functionality used by thousands of customers
- Vendor handles maintenance, updates, and security
- Predictable subscription costs
- Built-in best practices and compliance features
- Community support and training resources

**Disadvantages:**
- May not perfectly fit your unique processes
- Ongoing subscription costs (may exceed custom long-term)
- Vendor dependency for features and roadmap
- Limited customisation options
- Data portability concerns
- Feature bloat — paying for unused features

### Option 2: Build (Custom Development)
**What:** Develop a bespoke application tailored to your exact requirements.

**Advantages:**
- Perfect fit for your unique business processes
- Full control over features and roadmap
- No vendor dependency
- Can become a competitive differentiator
- No per-user licensing costs
- Intellectual property ownership

**Disadvantages:**
- Highest upfront cost (₹5-50 lakh+ for SMEs)
- Longest time to value (months to years)
- Requires ongoing development and maintenance team
- You're responsible for security, performance, and updates
- Risk of scope creep and budget overruns
- Technical debt accumulates over time

### Option 3: Integrate (Connect Existing Tools)
**What:** Use integration platforms to connect existing applications and fill functionality gaps.

**Advantages:**
- Leverages existing investments
- Often the fastest and cheapest solution
- No new application to learn or manage
- Can be implemented with no-code tools
- Flexible and adjustable

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited by the capabilities of existing applications
- Integration maintenance overhead
- May create complex dependencies
- Workaround feel — not a purpose-built solution
- Performance limitations for complex workflows

## Decision Framework

### Factor 1: Strategic Differentiation
**Question:** Does this functionality provide competitive advantage?

- **High differentiation → BUILD:** Your unique process deserves unique software
- **Low differentiation → BUY:** Standard business processes use standard tools
- **No differentiation → INTEGRATE:** Connect what you have

### Factor 2: Market Availability
**Question:** Do quality commercial options exist?

- **No good options → BUILD:** No choice but custom
- **Several good options → BUY:** Leverage vendor investment
- **Partial fit with existing tools → INTEGRATE:** Fill the gap

### Factor 3: Budget and Timeline
**Question:** What can you afford, and when do you need it?

- **Large budget, flexible timeline → BUILD** is an option
- **Moderate budget, medium timeline → BUY** is likely best
- **Limited budget, immediate need → INTEGRATE** for quick wins

### Factor 4: Technical Capability
**Question:** Do you have or can you hire development talent?

- **Strong in-house team → BUILD** is feasible
- **Moderate capability → BUY** and customise
- **Limited technical resources → INTEGRATE** with no-code tools

### Factor 5: Maintenance Commitment
**Question:** Can you sustain long-term application ownership?

- **Yes, committed team → BUILD** is sustainable
- **Prefer vendor management → BUY** for lower overhead
- **Minimal ongoing resources → INTEGRATE** for simplicity

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Build | Buy | Integrate |
|--------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Time to Value | Months | Days-Weeks | Days |
| Upfront Cost | High | Low-Medium | Low |
| Ongoing Cost | Medium (dev team) | Medium (subscription) | Low |
| Customisation | Unlimited | Limited | Limited by existing |
| Maintenance Burden | High (you own it) | Low (vendor) | Medium |
| Best For | Unique processes | Standard functions | Quick gaps |

## Hybrid Approaches

### Buy and Customise
Purchase a commercial platform that supports extensive customisation:
- Low-code platforms (Mendix, OutSystems, Appian)
- Highly configurable SaaS (Salesforce, ServiceNow)
- Open-source with custom extensions (Odoo, ERPNext)

**Best for:** Processes that are 70-80% standard with unique elements

### Buy and Integrate
Purchase best-of-breed tools and connect them:
- Use an integration platform (Zapier, Make, n8n) to link tools
- Build custom API integrations for complex flows
- Create unified dashboards across multiple tools

**Best for:** Organisations with diverse needs and no single platform fit

### Build on a Platform
Build custom applications on cloud platforms:
- Google AppSheet or Retool for internal tools
- AWS/Azure/GCP for scalable custom applications
- Airtable or Notion for semi-custom workflows

**Best for:** Teams with semi-technical users who need tailored workflows

## Common Scenarios and Recommendations

### Scenario: CRM
**Recommendation: BUY.** CRM is a solved problem with excellent SaaS options. SMEs should buy and customise (HubSpot, Zoho, Salesforce).

### Scenario: Industry-Specific Quoting Tool
**Recommendation: BUILD** (if no niche vendor exists) or **BUY** (if a specialised vendor serves your industry). Check niche marketplaces first.

### Scenario: Connecting Sales Data to Accounting
**Recommendation: INTEGRATE.** Use Zapier/Make to connect CRM to accounting software. No new application needed.

### Scenario: Custom Workflow for Regulatory Compliance
**Recommendation: BUY AND CUSTOMISE.** Start with a compliance platform and adapt to your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

- [ ] Define the functionality gap clearly

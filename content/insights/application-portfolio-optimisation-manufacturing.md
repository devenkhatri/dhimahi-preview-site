Industry-specific guidance for manufacturing businesses looking to rationalise their ERP, MES, QMS, and operational technology applications for maximum efficiency.

## The Manufacturing Application Landscape

### Typical Application Categories
Manufacturing SMEs typically operate across several technology layers, each with its own set of applications:

**Enterprise Layer:**
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
- HRM (Human Resource Management)
- Financial management and accounting
- Business intelligence and reporting

**Operations Layer:**
- MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
- SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
- QMS (Quality Management System)
- Supply chain management
- Inventory and warehouse management

**Engineering Layer:**
- CAD/CAM design software
- PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)
- BOM (Bill of Materials) management
- Simulation and analysis tools
- Document management

**Shop Floor Layer:**
- PLC programming tools
- Machine monitoring software
- Preventive maintenance systems
- Worker scheduling and tracking
- Safety management systems

### Common Portfolio Problems in Manufacturing
- ERP doesn't integrate with shop floor systems
- Multiple spreadsheet-based processes running parallel to official systems
- Quality data captured in separate, disconnected tools
- Maintenance records split across multiple platforms
- Production planning done partially in ERP, partially in spreadsheets
- Legacy custom applications built by former IT staff

## Assessment Framework for Manufacturing

### Critical Process Mapping
Before assessing individual applications, map your core manufacturing processes:

**Order-to-Delivery:**
1. Customer order received
2. Production planning and scheduling
3. Material procurement
4. Manufacturing execution
5. Quality inspection
6. Shipping and delivery
7. Invoicing and payment

**Application Coverage Analysis:**
For each process step, identify:
- Which applications support this step?
- Are there manual handoffs between applications?
- Where does data get re-entered?
- What information falls through the cracks?

### Manufacturing-Specific Assessment Criteria
Add these to your standard assessment:
- **Shop floor connectivity:** Can the application communicate with machines and PLCs?
- **Real-time capability:** Does the application support real-time data from production?
- **Traceability:** Does the application support lot tracking and genealogy?
- **Regulatory compliance:** Does it meet industry-specific regulations (ISO 9001, FDA, etc.)?
- **Scalability:** Can it handle increasing production volumes and complexity?

## Common Optimisation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ERP Consolidation
**Situation:** Multiple ERPs across locations or business units.
**Solution:** Consolidate to a single ERP platform with consistent processes.
**Benefits:** Unified data, standardised processes, volume licensing savings.
**Considerations:** Multi-site rollout complexity, change management, customisation consolidation.

### Scenario 2: MES Implementation
**Situation:** Production tracking done via spreadsheets and manual logs.
**Solution:** Implement MES integrated with ERP.
**Benefits:** Real-time production visibility, automated data collection, OEE improvement.
**Considerations:** Machine connectivity requirements, operator training, process standardisation.

### Scenario 3: Quality System Integration
**Situation:** QMS operates separately from production and ERP systems.
**Solution:** Integrate QMS with MES and ERP for closed-loop quality.
**Benefits:** Faster quality issue detection, automated nonconformance routing, regulatory compliance.
**Considerations:** Data model alignment, inspection point configuration, reporting migration.

### Scenario 4: Maintenance System Modernisation
**Situation:** Maintenance managed through paper-based work orders or basic spreadsheets.
**Solution:** Implement CMMS integrated with production and ERP.
**Benefits:** Reduced unplanned downtime, better spare parts management, maintenance cost visibility.
**Considerations:** Asset hierarchy setup, PM schedule migration, technician adoption.

## Industry 4.0 and Portfolio Strategy

### Emerging Technologies to Consider
- **IoT Platforms:** Connect machines and sensors for real-time data
- **AI/ML Analytics:** Predictive maintenance, quality prediction, demand forecasting
- **Digital Twins:** Virtual replicas of production lines for simulation
- **AR/VR:** Training, remote assistance, and maintenance guidance
- **Edge Computing:** Real-time processing at the machine level

### Integration with Portfolio Strategy
- Assess existing applications' ability to support Industry 4.0
- Identify gaps where new technologies are needed
- Prioritise investments that build on existing infrastructure
- Choose platforms with open APIs and integration capability
- Balance innovation with foundation optimisation

## Manufacturing APR Roadmap

### Quarter 1: Assessment
- Inventory all applications across enterprise, operations, and shop floor
- Map applications to manufacturing processes
- Assess integration maturity between systems
- Identify top 5 pain points and data gaps
- Calculate total portfolio spending

### Quarter 2: Strategy
- Apply TIME classification to all applications
- Define target architecture for integrated manufacturing
- Prioritise consolidation and modernisation projects
- Build business cases for top 3 initiatives
- Plan phased implementation

### Quarter 3-4: Execution
- Execute quick wins (license cleanup, retirement of unused tools)
- Begin priority migration or integration projects
- Standardise data formats and exchange protocols
- Train users on consolidated systems
- Measure and report progress

A well-optimised application portfolio is the foundation for manufacturing excellence. By eliminating redundancy, integrating systems, and building toward Industry 4.0, manufacturing SMEs can achieve significant efficiency gains and competitive advantage.

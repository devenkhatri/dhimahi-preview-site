Evaluate the security posture of every application in your portfolio. Learn to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and prioritise remediation for maximum protection.

## Why Application Security Matters for Portfolio Management

### The Expanding Attack Surface
Every application in your portfolio is a potential entry point for attackers. Legacy applications with outdated security, SaaS tools with weak configurations, and unmanaged shadow IT all contribute to a growing attack surface.

**Key Statistics:**
- 43% of cyber attacks target small and medium businesses
- Average cost of a data breach for SMEs: ₹15-50 lakh
- 60% of SMEs close within 6 months of a major breach
- 80% of breaches involve compromised credentials
- Unpatched applications account for 57% of data breaches

### Security as a Portfolio Decision Factor
Application security posture should be a primary factor in portfolio rationalisation decisions:
- Insecure applications should be prioritised for migration or elimination
- Security maintenance costs should be included in TCO calculations
- Vendor security practices should influence renewal decisions
- Compliance requirements should guide portfolio composition

## Security Assessment Framework

### Assessment Dimensions

**Authentication and Access Control:**
- Multi-factor authentication availability and enforcement
- Role-based access control granularity
- Password policy enforcement
- Session management practices
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration
- API key and token management

**Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data classification and handling
- Backup and recovery capabilities
- Data retention and disposal policies
- Personal data protection compliance (GDPR, PDPB)
- Cross-border data transfer controls

**Vulnerability Management:**
- Patch frequency and currency
- Known vulnerability count (CVEs)
- Penetration testing history
- Security audit results
- Bug bounty programme (if applicable)
- Vendor security advisories

**Compliance and Governance:**
- Industry certification (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Regulatory compliance attestations
- Audit trail and logging capabilities
- Incident response procedures
- Data processing agreements
- Subprocessor management

**Architecture and Infrastructure:**
- Network security controls
- Container and cloud security
- API security measures
- Dependency management
- Secure development lifecycle
- Disaster recovery capabilities

### Scoring Each Application
Rate each dimension on a 1-5 scale:
- **5:** Excellent – exceeds industry standards
- **4:** Good – meets all requirements
- **3:** Adequate – meets minimum requirements
- **2:** Below standard – gaps exist
- **1:** Critical – significant vulnerabilities

### Risk Classification
- **Score 4.0-5.0:** Low Risk – continue monitoring
- **Score 3.0-3.9:** Moderate Risk – remediation plan needed
- **Score 2.0-2.9:** High Risk – urgent attention required
- **Score 1.0-1.9:** Critical Risk – immediate action or elimination

## Vendor Security Evaluation

### Questions Every SME Should Ask
**Before Procurement:**
- What security certifications do you hold?
- How frequently are security patches released?
- What is your incident response process and SLA?
- Where is customer data stored and processed?
- Can we review your most recent penetration test summary?
- Do you offer multi-factor authentication?
- What happens to our data if we cancel the service?

**During the Relationship:**
- Have there been any security incidents affecting customer data?
- What new security features have been added this year?
- Can you provide an updated SOC 2 report?
- How do you manage third-party dependencies?
- What is your vulnerability disclosure process?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- No security certifications or audits
- Infrequent or irregular patching
- No multi-factor authentication option
- Vague or absent data processing agreements
- History of unreported security incidents
- No incident response SLA
- Data stored in jurisdictions without adequate protection laws

## Building a Security-Aware Portfolio Strategy

### Integrate Security into TIME Classifications
- **Invest:** Only in applications with strong security postures
- **Tolerate:** With mandatory security improvements and monitoring
- **Migrate:** Away from applications with irreparable security gaps
- **Eliminate:** Applications posing unacceptable security risk

### Security-Driven Portfolio Actions
**Immediate (This Week):**
- Enable MFA on all applications that support it
- Review and revoke unnecessary user access
- Identify applications without current security patches
- Disable or remove unused accounts

**Short-Term (This Month):**
- Conduct vendor security assessments for top 10 applications
- Implement SSO where possible to centralise access control
- Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity
- Create an application security policy

**Medium-Term (This Quarter):**
- Complete security assessment for entire portfolio
- Include security scores in portfolio dashboards
- Establish vendor security requirements for new procurements
- Plan migration from high-risk applications

## Security Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Inventory all applications and their security features
- [ ] Score each application across all security dimensions
- [ ] Identify applications missing critical security controls
- [ ] Review vendor security certifications and audit reports
- [ ] Enable MFA on all applications that support it
- [ ] Audit user access and remove unnecessary permissions
- [ ] Check all applications for current patch levels
- [ ] Create a remediation plan for high-risk applications

Security isn't separate from portfolio management—it's a fundamental dimension of application value. An application that creates security risk is reducing its net value to the business with every day it operates. Make security a first-class citizen in every portfolio decision.

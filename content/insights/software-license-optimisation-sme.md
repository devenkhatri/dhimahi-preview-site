Audit your software licenses to eliminate waste, right-size subscriptions, and negotiate better deals. Most SMEs can save 20-35% on licensing through proper optimisation.

## The License Waste Problem

### Common Sources of License Waste
**Unused Licenses:**
- Employees who left but licenses weren't reclaimed
- Seasonal or project-based licenses still active
- Free trial conversions never reviewed
- Licenses for features no one uses

**Over-Provisioned Licenses:**
- Enterprise tier when standard would suffice
- Admin licenses for users who only need viewer access
- Premium features enabled but unused
- Higher seat counts "just in case"

**Duplicate Licenses:**
- Same tool licensed through multiple procurement channels
- Department purchases overlapping with organisation-wide licenses
- Bundle inclusions not recognised (e.g., Visio included in Microsoft 365 E3)
- Free alternatives available within existing subscriptions

### Typical Savings Opportunities
| License Issue | Typical Waste | Potential Savings |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Unused licenses | 15-25% of seats | ₹1-5 lakh/year |
| Over-provisioned tiers | 20-30% of cost | ₹1-3 lakh/year |
| Duplicate tools | 10-20% of spend | ₹50K-2 lakh/year |
| Poor contract terms | 10-15% over market | ₹50K-2 lakh/year |

## License Audit Process

### Step 1: Inventory All Software Licenses
**What to document:**
- Application name and vendor
- License type (per-user, per-device, concurrent, site)
- Number of licenses purchased
- Current cost (monthly and annual)
- Contract start and end dates
- Auto-renewal terms and notice periods
- Bundle or suite inclusions

### Step 2: Map Usage to Licenses
**Usage metrics to collect:**
- Active users vs. licensed users
- Login frequency over the past 90 days
- Feature utilisation by user tier
- Peak concurrent usage (for concurrent licenses)
- Storage and bandwidth consumption

### Step 3: Identify Optimisation Opportunities
**Quick Analysis:**
- Compare licensed seats to active users
- Match user activity levels to license tiers
- Find overlapping functionality across tools
- Check if bundled features replace standalone tools
- Identify upcoming renewals for negotiation

### Step 4: Take Action
**Immediate savings (no vendor contact needed):**
- Remove licenses for inactive users
- Downgrade over-provisioned tiers
- Cancel duplicate subscriptions
- Switch from monthly to annual billing (typically 15-20% savings)

**Negotiation opportunities:**
- Volume discounts for consolidated purchases
- Multi-year commitment discounts
- Competitive pricing (reference alternatives)
- True-up and true-down flexibility
- Price caps for renewals

## Licensing Models Explained

### Per-User Licensing
**How It Works:** Each named user gets a license.
**Optimise By:** Regularly audit active users, reclaim unused seats promptly, use appropriate tiers.

### Concurrent/Floating Licensing
**How It Works:** A pool of licenses shared by users, limited by simultaneous use.
**Optimise By:** Analysing peak usage patterns, right-sizing the pool, scheduling usage across time zones.

### Consumption-Based (Pay-as-You-Go)
**How It Works:** Pay for what you use (API calls, storage, compute).
**Optimise By:** Monitoring usage patterns, setting alerts for spikes, using reserved capacity for predictable loads.

### Site/Enterprise Licensing
**How It Works:** Unlimited use within the organisation for a flat fee.
**Optimise By:** Maximising adoption to increase per-user value, leveraging for all departments, not purchasing individual licenses for included tools.

## Contract Negotiation Strategies

### Timing Your Negotiations
- Start 90 days before renewal
- Negotiate at vendor's fiscal quarter or year-end
- Leverage competitive evaluations during negotiations
- Time new purchases with vendor promotions

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- Usage data showing low utilisation
- Competitive alternatives evaluated
- Multi-year commitment willingness
- Reference customer or case study participation
- Consolidating spend with fewer vendors
- Payment terms flexibility (upfront vs. instalments)

### Key Contract Terms to Negotiate
- Price escalation caps (maximum annual increase)
- True-down rights (reduce licenses at renewal)
- Early termination provisions
- Data portability and exit assistance
- SLA commitments and remedies
- Audit rights and procedures

## Building a License Management Practice

### Governance Structure
- Designate a license manager or owner
- Centralise all software procurement through IT
- Establish standard evaluation and approval process
- Implement departure checklist including license reclamation
- Maintain a central license inventory database

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Monthly active user vs. licensed user reports
- Quarterly utilisation reviews by application
- Annual vendor contract reviews
- Automated alerts for unused licenses (30-day threshold)
- Dashboard showing total license spend and waste

### License Compliance
- Ensure you're not under-licensed (audit risk)
- Maintain documentation for all licenses
- Track licence transfers between employees
- Monitor vendor audit clauses
- Prepare audit response procedures

## Quick Wins Checklist

- [ ] Export a list of all active software subscriptions
- [ ] Compare licensed users to users who logged in this month
- [ ] Identify the top 3 applications by per-user cost
- [ ] Check if any bundled features replace standalone tools
- [ ] List renewals coming up in the next 90 days
- [ ] Calculate potential savings from removing inactive licenses
- [ ] Contact top 3 vendors about right-sizing options

Every rupee saved on unnecessary licenses is a rupee that can be invested in tools and capabilities that drive your business forward. Make license optimisation a quarterly practice, and the savings will compound year after year.

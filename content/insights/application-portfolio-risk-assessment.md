Identify and manage risks hidden in your application portfolio—from vendor dependence to technical debt. A comprehensive risk framework for SMEs.

## Understanding Portfolio Risk

### The Risk Landscape
Every application in your portfolio carries some degree of risk. Individually, these risks may be acceptable. But collectively, they can create a risk profile that threatens business continuity, financial stability, and competitive position.

**Categories of Portfolio Risk:**
- **Vendor Risk:** Dependence on vendors that may fail, change pricing, or discontinue products
- **Technical Risk:** Aging technology, accumulating technical debt, and architectural limitations
- **Security Risk:** Vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and attack surface exposure
- **Operational Risk:** Single points of failure, lack of redundancy, and integration fragility
- **Financial Risk:** Unpredictable cost escalations, vendor lock-in, and unfavourable contracts
- **Strategic Risk:** Portfolio unable to support business growth or transformation

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Vendor Risk Assessment

**Financial Viability:**
- Is the vendor profitable or consistently funded?
- What is the vendor's annual revenue and growth trend?
- Has the vendor been through acquisitions or ownership changes?
- Are there signs of financial distress (layoffs, delayed releases)?

**Product Continuity:**
- When was the last major product update?
- Is there a published product roadmap?
- Has the vendor announced end-of-life for any products?
- How large is the vendor's customer base for this product?
- Are competitors gaining significant market share?

**Concentration Risk:**
- How many critical applications depend on a single vendor?
- What percentage of your portfolio spending goes to your top vendor?
- Do you have alternatives identified for your most critical applications?
- What happens if your primary vendor doubles their pricing?

**Risk Scoring:**
- **Low (1-2):** Stable vendor, large customer base, strong roadmap
- **Medium (3):** Some concerns but manageable
- **High (4-5):** Significant vendor risk requiring mitigation

### Technical Debt Risk Assessment

**Code and Architecture Health:**
- Age of the application and its technology stack
- Availability of developers with relevant skills
- Quality and currency of documentation
- Frequency and recency of updates
- Known bugs and performance issues

**Support and Maintainability:**
- Are the underlying frameworks and libraries maintained?
- Is the operating system or runtime supported?
- Are security patches still available?
- Can the application scale to meet future needs?
- Is the application compatible with modern infrastructure?

**Technical Debt Indicators:**
- Increasing time required for each change or enhancement
- Growing number of workarounds and manual processes
- Rising support ticket volume
- Performance degradation over time
- Difficulty hiring talent familiar with the technology

### Operational Risk Assessment

**Availability and Resilience:**
- What is the application's uptime history?
- Is there a disaster recovery plan for this application?
- How long would it take to recover from a complete failure?
- Are backups regularly tested?
- Is there a documented business continuity plan?

**Dependency Mapping:**
- What other applications depend on this one?
- What would break if this application went down?
- How many integrations does it support?
- Is it a single point of failure for any business process?
- Are there circular dependencies in the portfolio?

**Key Person Risk:**
- Is there a single person who understands this application?
- Is institutional knowledge documented?
- Can the application be maintained by multiple team members?
- What happens if the application expert leaves?

## Risk Scoring and Prioritisation

### Composite Risk Score
For each application, calculate a composite risk score:

| Risk Category | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|--------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Vendor Risk | 20% | ___ | ___ |
| Technical Debt | 25% | ___ | ___ |
| Security Risk | 25% | ___ | ___ |
| Operational Risk | 20% | ___ | ___ |
| Financial Risk | 10% | ___ | ___ |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **___** |

### Risk Classification
- **1.0-2.0 (Low):** Monitor annually, no immediate action needed
- **2.1-3.0 (Moderate):** Develop mitigation plan, review quarterly
- **3.1-4.0 (High):** Active mitigation required, review monthly
- **4.1-5.0 (Critical):** Immediate action required, escalate to leadership

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For Vendor Risk
- Maintain identified alternatives for critical applications
- Negotiate data portability and exit assistance clauses
- Avoid vendor concentration above 30% of portfolio spend
- Monitor vendor financial health and market position
- Build relationships with multiple vendors in each category

### For Technical Debt
- Allocate 15-20% of IT budget to debt reduction
- Create a modernisation roadmap for high-debt applications
- Document all applications and institutional knowledge
- Invest in training for modern technologies
- Plan replacements 12-18 months before end-of-support dates

### For Operational Risk
- Implement automated failover for critical applications
- Test disaster recovery procedures quarterly
- Document all integrations and dependencies
- Cross-train team members on critical applications
- Maintain updated business continuity plans

### For Security Risk
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
- Implement zero-trust access controls
- Enable multi-factor authentication across the portfolio
- Monitor for security advisories and patches
- Include security scoring in all portfolio decisions

## Building a Risk Register

### Application Risk Register Template
| Application | Vendor Risk | Tech Debt | Security | Operational | Overall | Status |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| CRM | Low | Low | Low | Medium | Low | Monitor |
| Legacy ERP | Medium | High | High | High | High | Mitigate |
| Custom App | N/A | Medium | Medium | High | Medium | Plan |

### Risk Review Cadence
- **Critical/High:** Monthly review with active mitigation
- **Moderate:** Quarterly review and assessment update
- **Low:** Annual review and confirmation

## Getting Started

- [ ] List your top 10 most critical applications
- [ ] Assess vendor risk for each (financial health, product roadmap)
- [ ] Identify applications with the highest technical debt
- [ ] Map operational dependencies (what breaks if X goes down?)
- [ ] Calculate composite risk scores
- [ ] Prioritise the top 3 risks for immediate mitigation
- [ ] Create a risk register and schedule regular reviews

Risk is the hidden dimension of portfolio management that often gets overlooked until something goes wrong. By proactively assessing and mitigating risks across your portfolio, you protect your business from disruptions that could be far more costly than the applications they stem from.

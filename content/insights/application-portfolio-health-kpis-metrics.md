Define and track the right metrics to measure your application portfolio's health. From cost efficiency to user satisfaction, learn what to measure and why.

## Why Measure Portfolio Health?

### The Dashboard Gap
Most SMEs track individual application costs or uptime but lack a holistic view of portfolio health. Without comprehensive metrics, you're making portfolio decisions with incomplete information—like driving with only a speedometer and no fuel gauge.

**What Comprehensive Metrics Enable:**
- Data-driven investment decisions
- Early warning of emerging issues
- Justification for portfolio changes
- Progress tracking on optimisation initiatives
- Benchmarking against industry standards
- Executive communication and reporting

## Financial Metrics

### Total Portfolio Cost
**What:** The all-in annual cost of maintaining your entire application portfolio.
**Formula:** Sum of all licensing + infrastructure + support + integration + training costs.
**Target:** Should decrease 5-10% annually through optimisation.
**Review Frequency:** Monthly

### Cost per Application
**What:** Average annual cost for each application in the portfolio.
**Formula:** Total Portfolio Cost ÷ Number of Active Applications.
**Why It Matters:** Highlights the overhead of maintaining a large portfolio.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### Cost per User per Application
**What:** The fully loaded cost of each application for each active user.
**Formula:** Application TCO ÷ Number of Active Users.
**Why It Matters:** Identifies applications that are expensive relative to their user base.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### License Utilisation Rate
**What:** Percentage of purchased licenses actively being used.
**Formula:** (Active Users ÷ Licensed Users) × 100.
**Target:** Above 85%. Below 70% indicates significant waste.
**Review Frequency:** Monthly

### Software Spend as Percentage of Revenue
**What:** How much of your revenue goes to application costs.
**Formula:** (Total Portfolio Cost ÷ Annual Revenue) × 100.
**Industry Benchmark:** 3-6% for most SMEs.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

## Operational Metrics

### Application Count by Category
**What:** Number of applications serving each business function.
**Why It Matters:** Multiple applications per category indicates redundancy.
**Target:** Ideally 1-2 applications per category.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### Portfolio Age Distribution
**What:** The percentage of applications in each age bracket.
**Categories:**
- Modern (0-3 years): Target 40-50%
- Mature (3-7 years): Acceptable 30-40%
- Legacy (7+ years): Target below 20%
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### Integration Health Score
**What:** The percentage of integrations operating without errors.
**Formula:** (Successful Integration Runs ÷ Total Integration Runs) × 100.
**Target:** Above 99%.
**Review Frequency:** Weekly

### Application Availability
**What:** Uptime percentage for each critical application.
**Formula:** (Total Hours - Downtime Hours) ÷ Total Hours × 100.
**Target:** 99.5% or higher for business-critical applications.
**Review Frequency:** Monthly

### Support Ticket Volume by Application
**What:** Number of IT support tickets generated per application per month.
**Why It Matters:** High ticket volumes indicate usability or reliability issues.
**Target:** Decreasing trend quarter over quarter.
**Review Frequency:** Monthly

## Strategic Metrics

### Business Value Score
**What:** Weighted composite score of an application's business value.
**Components:** Strategic alignment + user satisfaction + process criticality + revenue impact.
**Scale:** 1-5, with 5 being highest value.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### Technical Health Score
**What:** Weighted composite score of an application's technical fitness.
**Components:** Architecture quality + security posture + performance + integration capability + vendor viability.
**Scale:** 1-5, with 5 being healthiest.
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### TIME Distribution
**What:** Percentage of applications in each TIME category.
**Healthy Distribution:**
- Invest: 20-30%
- Tolerate: 30-40%
- Migrate: 15-25%
- Eliminate: 5-15%
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

### Innovation Ratio
**What:** Percentage of IT budget spent on new capabilities vs. maintaining existing ones.
**Formula:** (Investment in new/strategic applications ÷ Total IT budget) × 100.
**Target:** At least 30% on innovation (run/grow/transform split).
**Review Frequency:** Annually

## User Experience Metrics

### User Satisfaction Score (Per Application)
**What:** Average satisfaction rating from application users.
**Collection Method:** Quarterly pulse survey (1-5 scale).
**Target:** 4.0 or above for strategic applications.

### Adoption Rate
**What:** Percentage of intended users actively using the application.
**Formula:** (Active Users ÷ Target Users) × 100.
**Target:** Above 80% for mandated applications.

### Productivity Impact
**What:** Estimated time saved or lost due to application quality.
**Collection Method:** User survey combining time spent on workarounds, manual processes, and waiting for application responses.
**Target:** Positive net productivity impact.

## Building Your Metrics Dashboard

### Essential Dashboard Elements
- Portfolio cost trend (12-month rolling)
- License utilisation heatmap
- TIME classification pie chart
- Top 10 applications by cost
- Bottom 10 applications by satisfaction
- Application count trend
- Integration health status
- Recent changes and actions

### Reporting Cadence
| Report | Audience | Frequency |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Operational Dashboard | IT Team | Weekly |
| Portfolio Health Summary | IT Leadership | Monthly |
| Cost and Value Report | CFO/Finance | Quarterly |
| Strategic Portfolio Review | Executive Team | Annually |

### Tools for Metrics Collection
- **Spreadsheets:** Google Sheets or Excel for initial tracking
- **BI Dashboards:** Power BI, Looker Studio, or Metabase
- **SaaS Management Platforms:** Zylo, Productiv, or Torii
- **Custom Dashboards:** Built on your existing data infrastructure

## Getting Started

- [ ] Define which metrics are most important for your organisation
- [ ] Identify data sources for each metric
- [ ] Set baseline measurements for your current state
- [ ] Define targets and improvement goals
- [ ] Create a simple dashboard (even a spreadsheet)
- [ ] Schedule regular review meetings
- [ ] Refine metrics based on decision-making needs

You can't improve what you don't measure. Start with a handful of critical metrics, ensure accurate data collection, and build your measurement practice over time. The goal isn't to track everything—it's to track the right things that drive better portfolio decisions.

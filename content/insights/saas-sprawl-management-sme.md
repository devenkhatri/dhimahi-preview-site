Discover practical strategies to identify, consolidate, and optimise your SaaS subscriptions to eliminate waste and reduce software spending by 20-40%.

## The SaaS Sprawl Challenge

### How SaaS Sprawl Develops
SaaS sprawl occurs when an organisation accumulates more software subscriptions than it needs or can effectively manage. With the ease of signing up for cloud services, SMEs often find themselves paying for dozens of overlapping, underused, or abandoned applications.

**The Progression:**
1. A team signs up for a free trial to solve an immediate problem
2. The trial converts to a paid subscription
3. Other teams adopt different tools for the same purpose
4. Subscriptions auto-renew without review
5. Former employees retain active licenses
6. The organisation loses track of total spending

**Typical SaaS Sprawl Statistics:**
- 25-30% of SaaS licenses are unused or underutilised
- Average SME has 3-4 overlapping tools per category
- 71% of SaaS subscriptions auto-renew without review
- 40% of SaaS spending happens outside IT budgets
- Companies waste ₹2-8 lakh annually on unused SaaS

### Categories with the Most Overlap
**Communication and Collaboration:**
- Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Discord
- Multiple video conferencing tools
- Several file-sharing platforms

**Project Management:**
- Asana, Trello, Monday.com, Jira, ClickUp
- Often 2-3 tools used by different teams
- Overlapping task and workflow features

**CRM and Sales:**
- HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, Pipedrive
- Separate tools for different sales functions
- Marketing tools with CRM overlap

**Data and Analytics:**
- Multiple dashboard and reporting tools
- Separate analytics for each department
- Duplicate data visualisation subscriptions

## SaaS Audit Process

### Step 1: Complete Inventory
**Data Collection Sources:**
- Finance: All recurring software charges
- IT: Managed application list and SSO integrations
- Departments: Team-specific tools and subscriptions
- Procurement: Purchase orders and vendor contracts
- Expense reports: Employee-reimbursed software

**Information to Capture:**
- Application name and vendor
- Monthly and annual cost
- Number of licenses purchased vs. active
- Primary users and department
- Contract renewal date and terms
- Integration with other systems
- Business function served

### Step 2: Usage Analysis
**Measuring Real Usage:**
- Login frequency per user over 90 days
- Feature utilisation across the application
- Time spent in the application per session
- Data created or modified in the application
- API calls and integration activity

**Usage Categories:**
- **Heavy users (daily):** Application is essential
- **Regular users (weekly):** Application is useful
- **Occasional users (monthly):** May be replaceable
- **Inactive users (no login in 60+ days):** Candidate for removal

### Step 3: Overlap and Redundancy Mapping
**Identify Functional Overlaps:**
- Map each application to the business functions it serves
- Highlight where multiple applications serve the same function
- Compare feature sets of overlapping applications
- Assess user preference and satisfaction for each
- Evaluate integration depth with core systems

### Step 4: Optimisation Actions
**Quick Wins (Week 1-2):**
- Remove inactive user licenses immediately
- Cancel applications with zero usage in 90+ days
- Downgrade plans where features are underutilised
- Consolidate multiple subscriptions into team or enterprise plans

**Medium-Term Actions (Month 1-3):**
- Consolidate overlapping tools into a single platform
- Negotiate better pricing with volume commitments
- Migrate users from inferior to superior tools
- Establish approved tool standards per category

**Strategic Actions (Quarter 1-2):**
- Implement SaaS management platform
- Create application governance policy
- Build approved vendor catalogue
- Establish renewal review process

## SaaS Optimisation Strategies

### License Right-Sizing
- Audit license types (admin, standard, viewer)
- Downgrade users who don't need premium features
- Switch to shared licenses for occasional users
- Negotiate true-up clauses for fluctuating headcount
- Implement just-in-time license provisioning

### Contract Negotiation Tactics
- Know your renewal dates at least 90 days in advance
- Benchmark pricing against competitors
- Leverage multi-year commitments for discounts
- Negotiate annual rather than monthly billing
- Request price locks for 2-3 year terms
- Bundle products from the same vendor

### Consolidation Opportunities
- Replace point solutions with platform suites
- Standardise on one tool per category organisation-wide
- Use built-in features before adding specialised tools
- Evaluate all-in-one platforms (Zoho One, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)
- Consider custom integrations over additional tools

## Building a SaaS Governance Framework

### Procurement Policy
- All SaaS purchases require IT review
- Standard evaluation criteria for new tools
- Approved vendor list by category
- Budget approval thresholds
- Mandatory security assessment for tools handling sensitive data

### Lifecycle Management
- Provisioning: Standard onboarding process for new tools
- Usage monitoring: Quarterly usage reviews
- Renewal management: 90-day pre-renewal review
- Offboarding: Automatic license reclamation on employee exit
- Retirement: Structured decommissioning process

### Continuous Monitoring
- Monthly SaaS spending dashboard
- Quarterly utilisation reviews
- Annual vendor and contract reviews
- Real-time alerts for new shadow subscriptions
- Regular employee surveys on tool satisfaction

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Export all credit card and bank statements for software charges
- [ ] Survey each department head about their team's tools
- [ ] List all applications with login credentials stored
- [ ] Check SSO provider for all connected applications
- [ ] Calculate total monthly SaaS spending
- [ ] Identify the top 5 most expensive subscriptions
- [ ] Find at least 3 overlapping tools for consolidation
- [ ] Set up a renewal calendar with 90-day alerts

Controlling SaaS sprawl isn't about restricting access to tools — it's about ensuring every subscription delivers value and every rupee spent on software contributes to business outcomes. Start with visibility, act on obvious waste, and build sustainable governance for the long term.

# How SMEs Can Save 5+ Hours/Week with AI

Start with small, repetitive tasks: follow-up emails, lead qualification, content drafts, and weekly reports. Pilot one workflow at a time, measure the time saved, then scale.

## Key Areas for AI Implementation

- **Automated follow-ups**: Set up email sequences that respond to customer inquiries
- **AI-assisted drafting**: Use tools to create proposals and content faster
- **Template-based proposals**: Standardize your sales process with smart templates
- **Report generation**: Automate weekly and monthly business reports

## Getting Started

1. Identify your most time-consuming repetitive tasks
2. Start with one simple automation
3. Measure the time saved
4. Gradually expand to other areas

The key is to start small and build momentum. Even saving 30 minutes per day adds up to significant productivity gains over time.

Establish a governance framework that ensures your application portfolio stays optimised over time, with clear policies, roles, and review cycles.

## Why Governance Matters

### The Portfolio Drift Problem
Without governance, an optimised application portfolio gradually deteriorates. New applications are added without assessment, old ones persist beyond their usefulness, and the same sprawl problems re-emerge within 12-18 months.

**Signs of Governance Gaps:**
- Anyone can purchase software without approval
- No standard process for evaluating new applications
- Retired applications reappear in different departments
- Portfolio reviews happen only during budget season
- No one owns the overall portfolio health
- Duplicate tools proliferate across teams

### Benefits of Portfolio Governance
- Sustained cost optimisation (not just one-time savings)
- Faster decision-making on technology investments
- Reduced security risk from unvetted applications
- Better vendor management and negotiation leverage
- Clear accountability for application decisions
- Alignment between IT spending and business strategy

## Governance Framework Components

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Portfolio Owner (CTO/IT Director):**
- Overall accountability for portfolio health
- Approves portfolio strategy and budget
- Reviews quarterly portfolio reports
- Sponsors governance initiatives

**Portfolio Manager (IT Manager/Lead):**
- Maintains application inventory and data
- Conducts regular portfolio assessments
- Coordinates vendor relationships
- Reports on portfolio metrics and KPIs

**Application Owners (Department Heads):**
- Accountable for their assigned applications
- Provide usage data and business justification
- Participate in assessment reviews
- Manage user access and training

**Technology Review Board (Cross-Functional):**
- Evaluates new application requests
- Reviews portfolio assessment results
- Approves migration and retirement plans
- Resolves cross-departmental conflicts

### Policies and Standards

**Application Procurement Policy:**
- All software purchases require governance review
- Standard evaluation criteria applied consistently
- Security assessment mandatory for data-handling tools
- Budget approval thresholds defined
- Preferred vendor list maintained

**Application Lifecycle Policy:**
- Onboarding standards for new applications
- Regular usage and value reviews
- Clear criteria for retirement decisions
- Data preservation requirements
- Decommissioning procedures

**Vendor Management Policy:**
- Vendor evaluation and selection criteria
- Contract review and approval process
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking
- Renewal review timelines (90 days minimum)
- Exit and transition planning requirements

## Review Cycles

### Monthly: Operational Review
- Active license count vs. utilisation
- New application requests and approvals
- Integration health and error rates
- Security alerts and patch compliance
- Budget vs. actual spending

### Quarterly: Portfolio Health Review
- TIME classification updates
- Application scoring refresh
- Vendor performance assessments
- Cost trend analysis
- Strategic alignment check

### Annually: Strategic Portfolio Review
- Complete portfolio reassessment
- Technology strategy alignment
- Multi-year roadmap update
- Budget planning for next year
- Vendor contract renewals and renegotiations

## Portfolio Metrics Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track
**Financial:**
- Total portfolio cost (monthly and annual)
- Cost per application and per user
- License utilisation rate
- Savings achieved from optimisation
- Budget variance

**Operational:**
- Number of active applications
- Applications per category
- Integration count and health
- Average application age
- Shadow IT incidents

**Quality:**
- User satisfaction scores
- Security compliance rate
- SLA attainment by application
- Downtime incidents
- Support ticket volume by application

**Strategic:**
- Percentage of applications aligned with strategy
- Innovation investment ratio (new vs. maintenance)
- Technical debt reduction progress
- Vendor diversity and concentration risk
- Cloud adoption percentage

## Implementation Roadmap

### Month 1: Foundation
- Define governance roles and responsibilities
- Draft initial policies (procurement, lifecycle, vendor)
- Create application inventory database
- Establish baseline metrics
- Communicate governance framework to the organisation

### Month 2: Operationalise
- Implement application request and approval process
- Set up portfolio dashboard and reporting
- Conduct initial portfolio assessment
- Begin monthly operational reviews
- Train application owners on their responsibilities

### Month 3: Optimise
- Refine processes based on initial experience
- Complete first quarterly portfolio review
- Identify and act on optimisation opportunities
- Expand governance to cover shadow IT
- Plan annual strategic review

### Ongoing: Mature
- Automate monitoring and reporting where possible
- Integrate governance with financial planning
- Expand vendor management practices
- Build continuous improvement culture
- Benchmark against industry peers

## Common Governance Challenges

### Balancing Control and Agility
- Keep approval processes fast (target: 5 business days)
- Offer self-service for low-risk categories
- Provide a pre-approved application catalogue
- Use risk-based tiering for assessment depth
- Focus governance on high-cost, high-risk decisions

### Gaining Organisational Buy-In
- Demonstrate value through early quick wins
- Involve business leaders in governance design
- Make governance an enabler, not a bottleneck
- Communicate savings and improvements regularly
- Celebrate successes and recognise contributors

Governance is the difference between a one-time cleanup and sustainable portfolio health. By investing in clear policies, defined roles, and regular reviews, you ensure your application portfolio continues to deliver maximum business value year after year.

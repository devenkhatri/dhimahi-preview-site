Ensure your application portfolio meets regulatory and compliance requirements. From data protection to industry standards, learn how to manage compliance across your software landscape.

## Compliance in the Application Portfolio Context

### Why Portfolio-Level Compliance Matters
Individual application compliance is necessary but insufficient. Regulators and auditors look at how data flows across your entire technology landscape—not just within single applications. A compliant CRM connected to a non-compliant spreadsheet still creates regulatory risk.

**Portfolio-Level Compliance Concerns:**
- Data flowing between compliant and non-compliant systems
- Personal data stored in applications not assessed for data protection
- Shadow IT handling regulated data without oversight
- Third-party vendors processing data without adequate agreements
- Audit trails fragmented across multiple systems
- Inconsistent access controls across the portfolio

### Key Regulatory Frameworks
**Data Protection:**
- Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) — India
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — EU/UK
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) — US

**Industry-Specific:**
- ISO 27001 — Information Security Management
- ISO 9001 — Quality Management
- SOC 2 — Service Organisation Controls
- PCI DSS — Payment Card Industry
- HIPAA — Healthcare (if applicable)

**Financial:**
- GST compliance and e-invoicing requirements
- Companies Act 2013 — Financial reporting
- RBI guidelines — For financial services

## Compliance Assessment for Applications

### Data Classification First
Before assessing compliance, classify the data each application handles:

**Tier 1 — Highly Sensitive:**
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Financial data (payment cards, bank accounts)
- Health records
- Employee records
- Trade secrets

**Tier 2 — Business Sensitive:**
- Customer transaction data
- Internal financial data
- Vendor contracts and pricing
- Business strategy documents
- Product designs and IP

**Tier 3 — General Business:**
- Marketing materials
- Public-facing content
- General correspondence
- Published policies
- Publicly available data

### Application Compliance Checklist
For each application handling Tier 1 or Tier 2 data:

**Data Handling:**
- [ ] Data processing agreement (DPA) in place with vendor
- [ ] Data residency requirements met (where is data stored?)
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Data retention policies configured
- [ ] Data deletion capability (right to erasure)
- [ ] Data export capability (data portability)

**Access Control:**
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication enabled
- [ ] Regular access reviews conducted
- [ ] Principle of least privilege applied
- [ ] Audit logging of access and changes

**Vendor Compliance:**
- [ ] Vendor holds relevant certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- [ ] Incident response SLA defined
- [ ] Breach notification process agreed
- [ ] Subprocessor list reviewed
- [ ] Regular compliance updates from vendor

## Compliance-Driven Portfolio Decisions

### Retire Non-Compliant Applications
Applications that cannot meet compliance requirements and have no vendor roadmap for compliance should be prioritised for retirement.

**Red Flags:**
- No encryption for sensitive data
- Vendor refuses to sign data processing agreement
- Data stored in non-compliant jurisdictions
- No audit trail capability
- No access control beyond basic login

### Consolidate to Reduce Compliance Scope
Fewer applications handling sensitive data means a smaller compliance scope:
- Consolidate customer data into the CRM (reduce the number of systems with PII)
- Centralise financial data in the ERP (reduce PCI DSS scope)
- Use a single document management system for regulated documents
- Standardise on SSO to centralise access control

### Migrate for Better Compliance
When current applications cannot meet requirements, migrate to alternatives with built-in compliance features:
- Cloud platforms with built-in encryption and compliance certifications
- SaaS applications with pre-configured data protection settings
- Vendors offering compliance management dashboards
- Platforms with automated data retention and deletion

## Building a Compliance Register

### Application Compliance Register Template
| Application | Data Tier | DPA? | Encryption? | MFA? | Certifications | Compliance Score |
|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| CRM | Tier 1 | Yes | Yes | Yes | SOC 2 | 5/5 |
| HR Tool | Tier 1 | Yes | Yes | No | ISO 27001 | 4/5 |
| Spreadsheets | Tier 2 | N/A | No | No | None | 1/5 |

### Maintaining the Register
- Update quarterly or when applications change
- Review after each new regulation or standard update
- Include in annual audit preparation
- Use as input for portfolio rationalisation decisions
- Share with compliance and legal teams

## Audit Readiness

### Preparing Your Portfolio for Audits
- Maintain complete application inventory with data classification
- Document all data flows between applications
- Keep vendor compliance documentation current
- Ensure audit trail access across all regulated applications
- Prepare evidence packages for each compliance requirement
- Conduct internal pre-audits quarterly

### Common Audit Findings to Prevent
- Sensitive data in non-assessed applications (shadow IT)
- Missing or outdated data processing agreements
- Inconsistent access controls across systems
- Incomplete audit trails for regulated transactions
- Data retained beyond retention periods
- Unused accounts with active access to regulated systems

## Action Plan

- [ ] Classify data handled by each application in your portfolio
- [ ] Identify all applications handling Tier 1 data
- [ ] Check data processing agreements for all Tier 1 applications
- [ ] Assess encryption, MFA, and access controls
- [ ] Build an application compliance register
- [ ] Flag non-compliant applications for migration or retirement
- [ ] Review vendor certifications and compliance documentation

Compliance is not optional—it's a non-negotiable requirement that should actively shape your portfolio strategy. By embedding compliance into your assessment and governance framework, you reduce risk, avoid penalties, and build trust with customers and regulators.

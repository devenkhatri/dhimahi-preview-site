Learn how cloud migration fits into your application portfolio strategy. Evaluate which applications to move to the cloud, which to keep on-premises, and how to execute a successful transition.

## Cloud as a Portfolio Optimisation Lever

### Why Cloud Matters for APR
Cloud migration isn't just about infrastructure—it's a portfolio optimisation opportunity. Moving applications to the cloud can reduce costs, improve scalability, enhance security, and enable integrations that weren't possible with on-premises deployments.

**Portfolio Benefits of Cloud Migration:**
- Convert capital expenditure to operational expenditure
- Eliminate infrastructure maintenance for migrated applications
- Access built-in high availability and disaster recovery
- Enable modern integrations through cloud APIs
- Scale resources dynamically with business demand
- Improve security posture through cloud provider investments

### Cloud Migration and the TIME Framework
- **Invest:** Migrate strategic applications to cloud for scalability and innovation
- **Tolerate:** Consider rehosting to reduce infrastructure burden
- **Migrate:** Cloud SaaS alternatives often exist for legacy applications
- **Eliminate:** Cloud migration analysis may reveal applications worth retiring

## Assessing Cloud Readiness

### Application Suitability Factors
**Good Candidates for Cloud Migration:**
- Web-based applications with standard architectures
- Applications with variable workloads (peak/off-peak)
- Collaboration tools benefiting from anywhere access
- Applications with heavy integration requirements
- Data-intensive applications needing scalable storage

**Challenging Candidates:**
- Applications with strict data residency requirements
- Real-time processing with ultra-low latency needs
- Applications with legacy dependencies (specific OS, hardware)
- Highly regulated applications requiring on-premises control
- Applications with large data volumes and expensive egress

### Cloud Deployment Models
**Public Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP):**
- Lowest cost for most SME workloads
- Broadest set of managed services
- Best for SaaS adoption and modern applications
- Concerns: data sovereignty, vendor lock-in

**Private Cloud (On-Premises or Hosted):**
- Maximum control and customisation
- Best for highly regulated industries
- Higher cost but dedicated resources
- Concerns: capital expense, maintenance burden

**Hybrid Cloud:**
- Best of both worlds for mixed portfolios
- Keep sensitive workloads on-premises, migrate the rest
- Flexible approach for phased migration
- Concerns: complexity, integration overhead

## Cloud Migration Strategies (The 6 Rs)

### Rehost (Lift and Shift)
Move applications as-is to cloud infrastructure.
- **Speed:** Fast (weeks)
- **Cost savings:** 10-20% infrastructure reduction
- **Best for:** Quick wins, buying time

### Replatform (Lift and Reshape)
Make targeted optimisations during migration.
- **Speed:** Moderate (weeks-months)
- **Cost savings:** 20-35% infrastructure reduction
- **Best for:** Databases, middleware upgrades

### Repurchase (Drop and Shop)
Replace with cloud-native SaaS alternatives.
- **Speed:** Moderate (depends on data migration)
- **Cost savings:** Variable, often significant
- **Best for:** CRM, HR, ERP, collaboration tools

### Refactor (Re-architect)
Rebuild applications for cloud-native architecture.
- **Speed:** Slow (months)
- **Cost savings:** 30-50% long-term
- **Best for:** Strategic applications needing scalability

### Retain
Keep on-premises for now.
- **When:** Compliance, latency, or migration risk too high
- **Plan:** Reassess quarterly as cloud services evolve

### Retire
Decommission instead of migrating.
- **When:** Application no longer needed or redundant
- **Savings:** Immediate infrastructure cost elimination

## Cost Analysis for Cloud Migration

### True Cloud Cost Calculation
**Monthly Cloud Costs:**
- Compute instances (VMs, containers, serverless)
- Storage (block, object, archival)
- Networking (data transfer, load balancing, VPN)
- Database services (managed vs. self-managed)
- Monitoring and management tools
- Security services and compliance tools

**Often Overlooked Costs:**
- Data egress charges for large data transfers
- Reserved instance commitment requirements
- Staff training and certification
- Migration project costs (one-time)
- Potential remediation for cloud compatibility

### Cost Comparison Framework
| Cost Category | On-Premises | Cloud |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Infrastructure hardware | ₹___/year | ₹0 |
| Cloud compute and storage | ₹0 | ₹___/year |
| IT staff for maintenance | ₹___/year | ₹___/year (reduced) |
| Software licensing | ₹___/year | ₹___/year |
| Disaster recovery | ₹___/year | ₹___/year (included) |
| **Total** | **₹___** | **₹___** |

## Migration Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Weeks 1-4)
- Categorise all applications by migration strategy
- Calculate cost projections for each approach
- Prioritise migration order (quick wins first)
- Design target cloud architecture
- Plan data migration approach

### Phase 2: Pilot Migration (Weeks 5-8)
- Migrate 2-3 low-risk applications first
- Validate performance and functionality
- Refine migration playbook
- Train IT team on cloud operations
- Establish monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Bulk Migration (Months 3-6)
- Execute migrations in prioritised batches
- Run parallel environments during transition
- Validate each migration before decommissioning
- Train users on any changes
- Optimise cloud resource allocation

### Phase 4: Optimisation (Ongoing)
- Right-size cloud resources based on actual usage
- Implement cost management and alerting
- Leverage reserved instances for stable workloads
- Adopt cloud-native services for better efficiency
- Continuous improvement of cloud operations

Cloud migration is one of the most impactful actions you can take in an application portfolio rationalisation programme. By strategically moving the right applications to the right cloud model, you unlock cost savings, improved capabilities, and a more agile technology foundation.

Master the Tolerate-Invest-Migrate-Eliminate framework to make confident, data-driven decisions about every application in your technology landscape.

## Understanding the TIME Framework

### Origins and Purpose
The TIME framework provides a structured approach to categorising applications based on their business value and technical health. Originally developed for enterprise portfolios, it's equally powerful for SMEs looking to optimise their technology investments.

**Why TIME Works:**
- Simple, intuitive categorisation
- Balances business and technical perspectives
- Provides clear action paths for each category
- Enables consistent decision-making across the organisation
- Scales from small portfolios to complex landscapes

### The Four Categories Explained

**Tolerate (Maintain as-is):**
These applications work adequately but aren't strategic. They solve a problem, but you wouldn't choose them again. Maintain them with minimal investment while planning long-term alternatives.

**Invest (Grow and expand):**
Your strategic winners. These applications deliver significant business value and have room for growth. Increase adoption, expand functionality, and deepen integration.

**Migrate (Move to better options):**
The functionality is needed, but the current platform is wrong. Plan and execute migrations to better alternatives that offer improved capabilities, lower costs, or better alignment.

**Eliminate (Retire and remove):**
Applications that no longer justify their cost or risk. Redundant, abandoned, or superseded applications that drain resources without delivering proportional value.

## Scoring Methodology

### Business Value Dimensions
**Strategic Alignment (Weight: 25%)**
- How well does the application support your business strategy?
- Does it enable competitive differentiation?
- Is it critical to revenue-generating processes?

**User Adoption and Satisfaction (Weight: 20%)**
- What percentage of intended users actively use it?
- How do users rate their experience?
- Are there frequent complaints or workarounds?

**Process Criticality (Weight: 25%)**
- How many business processes depend on this application?
- What happens if this application is unavailable for 24 hours?
- Can the business function without it?

**Revenue Impact (Weight: 15%)**
- Does the application directly contribute to revenue?
- Does it improve customer experience or retention?
- Does it enable sales or marketing effectiveness?

**Compliance Requirement (Weight: 15%)**
- Is the application required for regulatory compliance?
- Does it support audit and reporting needs?
- Are there legal or contractual obligations tied to it?

### Technical Health Dimensions
**Architecture Quality (Weight: 20%)**
- Is the application built on modern, supportable technology?
- Does it follow best practices for scalability?
- Is the codebase maintainable?

**Security Posture (Weight: 25%)**
- Is the application regularly patched and updated?
- Does it meet current security standards?
- Are there known vulnerabilities?

**Performance and Reliability (Weight: 20%)**
- Does the application meet performance SLAs?
- How often does it experience downtime?
- Can it handle current and projected loads?

**Integration Capability (Weight: 15%)**
- Does the application offer APIs for integration?
- Can it exchange data with other key systems?
- Is it part of automated workflows?

**Vendor Viability (Weight: 20%)**
- Is the vendor financially stable and growing?
- Is there a clear product roadmap?
- Is adequate support available?

## Classification Decision Matrix

### High Business Value + High Technical Health → INVEST
These are your crown jewels. Maximise their potential.

**Actions:**
- Expand user adoption across the organisation
- Invest in advanced features and customisation
- Negotiate favourable long-term contracts
- Integrate deeply with other strategic applications
- Train power users and champions

### High Business Value + Low Technical Health → MIGRATE
The need is real, but the platform must change.

**Actions:**
- Evaluate modern replacement options
- Create a detailed migration plan with timelines
- Budget for data migration and user training
- Plan for parallel running during transition
- Minimise further investment in current platform

### Low Business Value + High Technical Health → TOLERATE
Good technology, but limited business impact.

**Actions:**
- Reduce spending to minimum viable levels
- Consider repurposing for other use cases
- Monitor for changes in business relevance
- Maintain security patches and updates
- Review classification annually

### Low Business Value + Low Technical Health → ELIMINATE
Clear candidates for retirement.

**Actions:**
- Identify any data that must be preserved
- Communicate retirement timeline to users
- Provide alternative solutions for remaining use cases
- Execute decommissioning plan
- Reallocate freed resources

## Practical Application Tips

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Emotional attachment:** Don't keep applications because "we've always used them"
- **Sunk cost fallacy:** Past investment shouldn't dictate future decisions
- **Incomplete data:** Ensure you have accurate usage and cost data before classifying
- **Ignoring shadow IT:** Include unofficial applications in your assessment
- **One-time exercise:** APR should be a continuous process, not a one-off project

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Involve business leaders in value assessment
- Include IT teams in technical evaluation
- Get user input on satisfaction and needs
- Communicate decisions transparently
- Provide clear rationale for each classification

### Governance and Review
- Review classifications quarterly
- Update scores when significant changes occur
- Track actions and progress against plans
- Report outcomes to leadership
- Adjust strategy based on results

The TIME framework transforms subjective opinions about applications into objective, defensible decisions. By applying it consistently, you build a portfolio management discipline that continuously optimises your technology investments and ensures every rupee spent on software delivers measurable business value.
